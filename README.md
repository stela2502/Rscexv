# Rscexv

This package is mean to replace the R code in the SCExV server in the next update.
The package was created as an integral part of the R- the grouping had to be enhanced, which most likely would break the existing code at about 1000 places.
So the rigid testing available with an R::S4 class might become worth the hassle.

THis package should up to now not be installed anywhere!
