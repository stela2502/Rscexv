# Rscexv

This package is meant to replace the R code in the SCExV server in the next update.

During the next update of the SCExV server an upgrade to the grouping is planned, which most likely will break the existing code. Therefore the rigid testing available with an R::S4 class might become important.

This package is under heavy development at the moment and should not be used!
